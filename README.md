# About this Project
<h3><a href="https://stackblitz-starters-poqhpv.stackblitz.io/" target="_blank">Live Demo</a></h3>
This was a resume maker that I decided to build for the fun of it. I have been learning react for the past few weeks, and decided that it would be a good time to try and put my React skills to the test! This project is simple in concept -- you enter your details like job experience, name, email, address, education, and more and the generator will create a live resume side by side (you can see you're resume being created live while you enter your details)! Overall, it was a very fun (but also pretty hard) project to work on!

# How to Use it/How it Works
You can start by first opening up the website <a href="https://stackblitz-starters-poqhpv.stackblitz.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. You'll be greeted with a page that looks something like this:


<img width="1265" alt="image" src="https://github.com/PkTheCoda/resume-maker/assets/107774675/3ece656b-4bd8-494c-a387-85ee27140716">

On the left side of the page is where all you're inputs/information handlers are. You will enter any information there. On the right side is the live preview of your resume as you enter more information. When the page is first opened, nothing will show up, but as you start to enter more information, you'll see the resume slowly build itself. I'm going to go ahead and enter some filler text so you can see how it looks like:

Now you can start to see the resume come to life. As you start to type, the headings, styles, fonts, etc. will all start to show up (conditional rendering!). If you keep scrolling down, you'll see that there's a ton more inputs for things like entering job experiences, entering your education, and much more. It'll look something like this:

Now, I'm just going to go ahead and enter some information so that the entire resume is filled up. Here's how it'll look when everything is filled out:

So yeah, that's basically it. One last feature I decided to add for the fun of it was an "add job experiences" button. If you click on it, another set of inputs will be created so you can enter more job details/experiences since I realize that many people have multiple jobs/work experiences. 

# What this project has taught me

Phew. This project was actually a lot of work. I had to use so much of what I learned over the past 3ish weeks and combine it all in a project that I did over the course of 2 days. I learned so many different skills and concepts and "mastered" a few ones I would say.

<h3>Things I learned making this</h3>
- Using functional components in React
<br>
- Condtionally rendering elements and styles with React and CSS
<br>
- Learning how to use inputs in React
<br>
- Learned a LOT about manipulated objects and methods like .map()
<br>
- Practiced a ton of props and state in react
<br>
- Learned useEffect() hook in react. (Ended up not using it, but I learned it!)



<h4>I also learned a LOT of css topics and skills like: </h4>
      - <code>height: auto;</code>
<br>
      - Played around with a ton of Flexbox and CSS Grid
<br>
      - Practiced Responsive design a TON! Learned how to PROPERLY use responsive units like <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>vw & vh</code>
      
<h3>What I would plan to add:</h3>

I definitely want to come back to this project at a later time, and if I do, I would probably add these functionalities:
<ol>
  <li>Add a dark/light mode and be able to toggle them</li>
  <li>Be able to delete job experiences</li>
  <li>Be able to add additional Educational Experiences</li>
  <li>Make the actual resume preview look better</li>
  <li>Allow the user to change the different styles/sections of the actual resume</li>
  <li>Clean up my horrific code ðŸ˜­</li>

Overall, this project was an absolute blast. It felt so complex when I started creating it, but breaking it down into steps definitely helps. I can't wait to make more fun stuff in the future with React!
